# Sim-SPR
# An Open-Source Implementation for Surface Plasmon Resonance Applications
## Description:

In this description we present our free, open-source implementation for Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) applications implemented in C++ language. We wonder to ourself why implement yet another SPR simulator? Because there is no available open-simulation tool specifically built in the context of SPR applications in the literature. To understand Surface Plasmon Resonance phenomenon we need to know from Maxwell's equations to Fresnel equations, because these fundamentals are base of SPR phenomenon, mainly Fresnel equations that determine the reflection and transmission of light incident on an interface of two media with two different indices of refraction. Also, for this flexible free-software is included different techniques for electromagnetic simulations. 

This open-source implementation is being developing under principles of software engineering, which means that a structured design method is being used, the implementation being refined methodically with increasingly detailed levels. Sensors based in SPR phenomenon has being used often at the past last decades such as in the environment of biomedical research, antibody-antigen interaction, specialized equipment and some medical applications. Therefore, the main contributions of this work can be summarized as an open SPR simulator for the open source community.
